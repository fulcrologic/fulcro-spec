== Features

The macros in fulcro-spec wrap clojure/cljs test, so that you may use any of the features of the core library.
The specification DSL makes it much easier to read the tests, and also includes a number of useful features:

- Left-to-right assertions
- More readable output, such as data structure comparisons on failure (with diff notation as well)
- Mocking of normal functions, including native javascript (but as expected: not macros or inline functions)
    - Mocking verifies call sequence and call count
    - Mocks can easily verify arguments received
    - Mocks can simulate timelines for CSP logic

== Running Tests

You define the tests using deftest, so running them is normal.  The recommended setup for full stack testing is as
is done in the Fulcro Spec repository itself.

The following files are of interest:

`src/test`:: The source of some tests (clj and cljs). The cljs cards use Workspaces cards for browser rendering.
`deps.edn`:: The dependency and alias definitions. Note the kaocha setup.
`tests.edn`:: Kaocha config, for running tests via tools.deps
`.circleci/config.yml`:: A CI example
`karma.conf.js`:: Config for Karma cljs runner
`shadow-cljs.edn`:: Compile configs for building tests in workspaces
`package.json`:: For CLJS deps.
`Makefile`:: A sample UNIX make file for running the tests quickly from a command line with `make`.

== Anatomy of a specification

The main testing macros are `specification`, `behavior`, `component`, and `assertions`:

`specification` is just an alias for `deftest`.

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [specification behavior component assertions])

(specification "A Thing"
  (component "A Thing Part"
    (behavior "does something"
      (assertions
        form => expected-result
        form2 => expected-result2

        "optional sub behavior clause"
        form3 => expected-result3)))
----

See the clojure.spec.alpha/def for `::assertions` in link:../src/fulcro_spec/assertions.cljc[assertions.cljc] for the grammar of the `assertions` macro.

[NOTE]
====
`component` is an alias of `behavior`. +
It can read better if you are describing a *component* footnote:[
    *Noun*: a part or element of a larger whole.
    *Adjective*: constituting part of a larger whole; constituent.
    ] and not a behavior footnote:[*Noun*: the way in which a natural phenomenon or a machine works or functions.].
====

[TIP]
====
`specification` =outputs=> `(clojure|cljs).test/deftest`, +
`behavior` =outputs=> `(clojure|cljs).test/testing`.

You are therefore free to use any functions from https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html[clojure.test] or https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Testing[cljs.test] inside their body.

However, we recommend you use these macros as opposed to `deftest` and `testing` as they emit extra reporting events that are used by our renderers. +
You are however ok to use `is` instead of `assertions` if you prefer it.
====

=== Assertions

Assertions provides some explict arrows, unlike https://github.com/marick/Midje[Midje] which uses black magic, for use in making your tests more concise and readable.

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [assertions])

(assertions
  actual => expected ;;<1>
  actual =fn=> (fn [act] ... ok?) ;;<2>
  actual =throws=> ExceptionType ;; <3><6>
  actual =throws=> #"message regex")
----
<1> Checks that actual is equal to expected, either can be anything.
<2> `expected` is a function takes `actual` and returns a truthy value.
<3> Expects that actual will throw an Exception and checks that the type is `ExceptionType`.

=== Mocking

The mocking system does a lot in a very small space. It can be invoked via the `provided` or `when-mocking` macro.
The former requires a string and adds an outline section. The latter does not change the outline output.
The idea with `provided` is that you are stating an assumption about some way other parts of the system are behaving for that test.

Mocking must be done in the context of a specification, and creates a scope for all sub-outlines. Generally
you want to isolate mocking to a specific behavior:

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [specification behavior when-mocking assertions])

;; source file
(defn my-function [x y] (launch-rockets!))
;; spec file
(specification "Thing"
  (behavior "Does something"
    (when-mocking
      (my-function arg1 arg2)
      => (do (assertions
               arg1 => 3
               arg2 => 5)
           true)
      ;;actual test
      (assertions
        (my-function 3 5) => true))))
----

Basically, you include triples (a form, arrow, form), followed by the code & tests to execute.

It is important to note that the mocking support does a bunch of verification at the end of your test:

. It uses the mocked functions in the order specified.
. It verifies that your functions are called the appropriate number of times (at least once is the default) and no more if a number is specified.
. It captures the arguments in the symbols you provide (in this case arg1 and arg2). These are available for use in the RHS of the mock expression.
. If the mocked function has a `clojure.spec.alpha/fdef` with `:args`, it will validate the arguments with it.
. It returns whatever the RHS of the mock expression indicates.
. If the mocked function has a `clojure.spec.alpha/fdef` with `:ret`, it will validate the return value with it.
. If the mocked function has a `clojure.spec.alpha/fdef` with `:fn` (and `:args` & `:ret`), it will validate the arguments and return value with it.
. If assertions run in the RHS form, they will be honored (for test failures).

So, the following mock script should pass:

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [when-mocking assertions])

(when-mocking
  (f a) =1x=> a ;;<1>
  (f a) =2x=> (+ 1 a) ;;<2>
  (g a b) => 17 ;;<3>

  (assertions
    (+ (f 2) (f 2) (f 2)
       (g 3e6 :foo/bar)
       (g "otherwise" :invalid)) <4>
    => 42))
----

<1> The first call to `f` returns the argument.
<2> The next two calls return the argument plus one.
<3> `g` can be called any amount (but at least once) and returns 17 each time.
<4> If you were to remove any call to `f` or `g` this test would fail.

==== Clojure.spec mocking integration

However, the following mock script will fail due to clojure.spec.alpha errors:

[source]
----
(:require
  [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [when-mocking assertions])

(s/fdef f
  :args number?
  :ret number?
  :fn #(< (:args %) (:ret %)))
(defn f [a] (+ a 42))

(when-mocking
  (f "asdf") =1x=> 123 ;; <1>
  (f a) =1x=> :fdsa ;; <2>
  (f a) =1x=> (- 1 a) ;; <3>

  (assertions
    (+ (f "asdf") (f 1) (f 2)) => 42))
----
<1> Fails the `:args` spec `number?`
<2> Fails the `:ret` spec `number?`
<3> Fails the `:fn` spec `(< args ret)`

==== Spies

Sometimes it is desirable to check that a function is called but still use its original definition, this pattern is called a test spy.
Here's an example of how to do that with fulcro spec:

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [when-mocking assertions])

(let [real-fn f]
  (when-mocking f => (do ... (real-fn))
  (assertions
    ...)
----

==== Protocols and Inline functions

When working with protocols and records, or inline functions (eg: https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/clojure-1.8.0/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L965[+]), it is useful to be able to mock them just as a regular function.
The fix for doing so is quite straightforward:
[source]
----
;; source file
(defprotocol MockMe
  (-please [this f x] ...)) ;;<1>
(defn please [this f x] (-please this f x)) ;;<2>

(defn fn-under-test [this]
  ... (please this inc :counter) ...) ;;<3>

;; test file
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [when-mocking assertions])

(when-mocking
  (please this f x) => (do ...) ;;<4>
  (assertions
    (fn-under-test ...) => ...))) ;;<5>
----
<1> define the protocol & method
<2> define a function that just calls the protocol
<3> use the wrapper function instead of the protocol
<4> mock the wrapping function from (2)
<5> keep calm and carry on testing

=== Timeline testing

On occasion you'd like to mock things that use callbacks. Chains of callbacks can be a challenge to test, especially
when you're trying to simulate timing issues.

[source]
----
(:require
  [cljs.test :refer [is]]
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [specification provided with-timeline
                               tick async]])

(def a (atom 0))

(specification "Some Thing"
  (with-timeline
    (provided "things happen in order"
              (js/setTimeout f tm) =2x=> (async tm (f))

              (js/setTimeout
                (fn []
                  (reset! a 1)
                  (js/setTimeout
                    (fn [] (reset! a 2)) 200)) 100)

              (tick 100)
              (is (= 1 @a))

              (tick 100)
              (is (= 1 @a))

              (tick 100)
              (is (= 2 @a))))
----

In the above scripted test the `provided` (when-mocking with a label) is used to mock out `js/setTimeout`. By
wrapping that provided in a `with-timeline` we gain the ability to use the `async` and `tick` macros (which must be
pulled in as macros in the namespace). The former can be used on the RHS of a mock to indicate that the actual
behavior should happen some number of milliseconds in the *simulated* future.

So, this test says that when `setTimeout` is called we should simulate waiting however long that
call requested, then we should run the captured function. Note that the `async` macro doesn't take a symbol to
run, it instead wants you to supply a full form to run (so you can add in arguments, etc).

Next this test does a nested `setTimeout`! This is perfectly fine. Calling the `tick` function advances the
simulated clock. So, you can see we can watch the atom change over \"time\"!

Note that you can schedule multiple things, and still return a value from the mock!

[source]
----
(:require
  [fulcro-spec.core :refer [provided with-timeline async]])

(with-timeline
  (when-mocking
     (f a) => (do (async 200 (g)) (async 300 (h)) true)))
----

the above indicates that when `f` is called it will schedule `(g)` to run 200ms from \"now\" and `(h)` to run
300ms from \"now\". Then `f` will return `true`.

== REPL Usage (Clojure)

The terminal reporter is quite easy and useful to use at the REPL for Clojure. Simply start a REPL, and define a keyboard shortcut to run something like this:

[source]
-----
;; make sure you put the REPL in the (possibly reloaded) ns (your REPL might be closing over an old version)
(in-ns (.getName *ns*))
;; Make sure the REPL runner is loaded
(require 'fulcro-spec.reporters.repl)
;; Run all tests in current ns
(fulcro-spec.reporters.repl/run-tests)
-----

=== Controlling Stack Trace Output

There are two dynamic vars that can be used to filter/limit stack traces in the outline output:

`fulcro-spec.reporters.terminal/*exclude-files*`:: What (simple) filenames to ignore stack frames from. (default `#{"core.clj" "stub.cljc"}`)
`fulcro-spec.reporters.terminal/*stack-frames*`:: How many non-filtered frames to print (default 10)

Use `alter-var-root` to reset the value of these globally.
