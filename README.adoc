== CHANGE OF SCOPE NOTICE

**BREAKING CHANGES** as of 3.1.  The `=throws=>` clause now just takes either a type
or a regex. Not maps/lists.

**BREAKING CHANGES** as of 3.0. Do NOT upgrade without being prepared to port your
test runners.

IMPORTANT: This library no longer contains browser-based runners.

I recommend the following alternatives:

Clojure Tests:: I recommend IntelliJ/Emacs/Vim in-editor testing, or perhaps
Clojure Tools Deps with kaocha. The latter renders into a terminal, but can use fulcro-spec's
macros. Here is a sample config file that will use Fulcro spec's terminal reporting:

[source, clojure]
-----
#kaocha/v1
    {:tests    [{:id           :unit
                 :ns-patterns  ["-test$" "-spec$"]
                 :test-paths   ["src/test"]
                 :skip-meta    [:integration]
                 :source-paths ["src/main"]}]
     :reporter [fulcro-spec.reporters.terminal/fulcro-report]
     :plugins  [:kaocha.plugin/randomize
                :kaocha.plugin/filter
                :kaocha.plugin/capture-output]}
-----

Clojurescript Tests:: I highly recommend using Nubank's Workspaces.  I've contributed a
shadow-cljs target that can auto-scan for tests if you use their deftest macro. Again, things
like the `provided` macro work within Workspaces.  I recommend using shadow-cljs
`:karma` target for running CI tests.

See https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-spec/blob/main/docs/index.adoc[the docs] for more details.

== Description

A Clojure(scipt) testing library to augment the standard `clojure.test`.

Release: image:https://circleci.com/gh/fulcrologic/fulcro-spec/tree/main.svg?style=svg["CircleCI", link="https://circleci.com/gh/fulcrologic/fulcro-spec/tree/main"]

== NEW!  REPL Runner

It is common to want to run tests in the REPL, but the output of the default runner leaves a lot to be desired.  If
you're using IntelliJ you can now add something like this to your REPL commands (and hook it to a keyboard shortcut) for a much
better testing experience:

Run Tests with a `:focus` metadata marker (selector):

```
(in-ns (.getName *ns*))
(require 'fulcro-spec.reporters.repl)
(fulcro-spec.reporters.repl/run-tests #(:focus (meta %)))
```

Run all tests:

```
(in-ns (.getName *ns*))
(require 'fulcro-spec.reporters.repl)
(fulcro-spec.reporters.repl/run-tests)
```

NOTE: Be sure to check "Before Executing" -> "Load File" on the REPL command.

== Usage

[source, clojure]
-----
(ns my-test
  (:require
    [fulcro-spec.core :refer [when-mocking provided assertions]
    [clojure.test :refer [deftest]]
    ...))

(defn f [x] 900)
(defn g [y] (+ y (f y)))

(deftest my-test
  (when-mocking
    (f x) => 22

    (assertions
      "mocking works"
      (g 9) => 31)))
